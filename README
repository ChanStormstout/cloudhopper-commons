ch-commons-charset

The ch-commons-charset library provides utility classes for converting between
charsets (mostly "mobile" in nature) such as Unicode to GSM and vice versa.
This library attempts to contain the fastest and most efficient methods for
converting charsets to/from byte arrays. For example, the method to convert a
Java string to a byte array of UTF-8 bytes is several times faster than using
Java's String.getBytes("UTF-8") method.

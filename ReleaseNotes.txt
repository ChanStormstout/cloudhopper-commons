Cloudhopper Commons Util Library
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.0 - 2009-02-16
  * WARN: Removed all non-util packages into their own projects since we now
    have a common build framework.  A large number of dependencies are now gone
    which should make all projects that use this library smaller.  Only classes
    in the net.cloudhopper.util package exist in this library.
  * Added StringUtil.capitalize() method -- removes need for WordUtils from
    Apache commons lang library in some other libraries.
  * Added ClassUtil.getBeanProperty() method -- obtains properties that follow
    the bean naming convention and allows simple access for getting and setting
    values either via the setter/getter methods or by falling back to the underlying
    field value.

1.6 - 2009-02-13
  * Added EncryptUtil class for simple 2-way encryption.
  * Added Country and CountryUtil class
  * Added DateTimeUtil
  * Removed bean, dao packages: moved to ch-cortex project.
  * Moved DataSourceFactory to new sql package
  * Added StringUtil.isSafeString() method to check for strings that have a
    very limited set of characters permitted.  Useful for checking passwords
    etc.
  * Added TimeZone and TimeZoneUtil class for displaying and manipulating time
    zones.
  * Rewrote build system to use ant-common-build as well maven for dependency
    management.

1.5 - 2009-01-03
  * Added Hasher class to make hashing bytes or Strings easier. Useful for
    hashing passwords, credit card numbers, etc. and storing them in a database.
  * Added DataSourceFactory and DatabaseUtil in new db package.
  * Added TimedStateAtomicBoolean to track how long an AtomicBoolean has retained
    its current value.
  * Added PeriodFormatterUtil for creating a few handy formatters of a
    DateTime.
  * Added NameValue that supports generics.
  * Added MetaField annotation and Utility class.
  * Added DecimalUtil for formatting double values in a thread-safe way.
  * Added RunningTotal and RunningAverage classes for an easy way of tracking
    a moving total or average with a set number of last values.
  * Start of, but unfinished generic Dao library.

1.4 - 2008-12-19
  * Added ByteBuffer.hashCode() to make it safe to put in HashMaps or
    Hashtables.
  * Fixed bug with ByteBuffer.delete() which did not accept a value of 0
    for the count of bytes.
  * Changed behavior of ByteBuffer.remove(0) which threw an exception so
    that it now returns a zero length byte array. 
  * Added StringUtil.getAsciiString(byte[])
  * Fixed bug with ByteBuffer.indexOf() method that missed correctly finding
    an occurrence that was in a circular part of the buffer. Added extra test
    coverage for this case.
  * Added ByteBuffer.occurrences() method to search for the number of
    times a sequence of bytes occur in a non-overlapping manner.
  * Added additional toArray() methods, new copy() methods, and a split()
    method to ByteBuffer class.
  * Added gsm package of utility classes.
  * Added Sequencer class to generate overflow-safe sequence numbers in
    a thread-safe manner.
  * Added stripQuotes to StringUtil.

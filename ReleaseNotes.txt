1.3.0 - 2012-02-14
  * Added support for "type" attribute on any property. Allows specific types
    of objects to be created rather than only instances of of the property itself.
    Useful for configuring objects with properties of a superclass or interface
    so that creating specific concrete instances is easy.  For example, assuming
    a property is of type Number, specific instances of a Number could be created:
       
      <property type="java.lang.Integer">1</property>
      
  * Hex format is now permitted for any byte, short, int, or long.  The number
    starts with 0x or 0X and is not permitted to be negative.  For example:
 
      <property>0xFF</property>
 
  * Cleaned up converter source code by adding source annotations for overrides.

2.0.0 - 2012-02-14
  * Upgrade parent POM to 1.6
  * Moved compile dependency of slf4j-api to test
  * PropertyConverter and impl classes all renamed to TypeConverter
  * Added XmlBeanFactory to simplify the process of creating a new object and
    configuring it all in 1 method call.
  * Added support for Collections.  Any class implementing the Collection
    interface can have items/elements added automatically with child elements.
    The underlying generic parameterized type is reflected from the specific
    Collection object to automatically determine what types of values to add.
    For example, assuming you have a field such as:
      
      ArrayList<String> hosts;

    This can easily be configured with the following XML snippet:

      <hosts>
        <host>www.twitter.com</host>
        <host>www.google.com</host>
      </hosts>

  * Added support for "type" attribute on any property. Allows specific types
    of objects to be created rather than only instances of of the property itself.
    Useful for configuring objects with properties of a superclass or interface
    so that creating specific concrete instances is easy.  For example, assuming
    a property is of type Number, specific instances of a Number could be created:
       
      <property type="java.lang.Integer">1</property>
      
  * Hex format is now permitted for any byte, short, int, or long.  The number
    starts with 0x or 0X and is not permitted to be negative.  For example:
 
      <property>0xFF</property>
 
  * Cleaned up converter source code by adding source annotations for overrides. 
  * All demo code moved to src/test/com/cloudhopper/xbean/demo

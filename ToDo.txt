  * Add Annotations support for enforcing rules on values such as unsigned
    values, values >= 0, list of acceptable values, etc.  Allow utility methods
    for accessing these annotations for other classes when trying to set
    properties.
  * Check that partial XML snippets actually work -- had issues using them while
    working on cortex project.

* Support for binary messages

* Full Javadocs on API

* Provide a better common implementation of a "sender" framework similar to
  how a servlet implementation was provided.

* Provide a simulator servlet that can have various options turned on/off at
  runtime to mimic error scenarios.

* Some additional unit tests -- perhaps a test suite for customer implementations
  of our protocol?

* Add an "enquire_link" implementation.  Calling it a PingRequest or KeepAliveRequest
  is probably what I'm going after.

* Load tester/simulator app?  Perhaps combine together with various tools above
  into the same package.

* Provide "standard" error codes?

  * Added feature to support integer types configured as hex values such as
    0x34 for a byte value.  Anything with a prefix of 0x will be treated as hex
  * Add Annotations support for enforcing rules on values such as unsigned
    values, values >= 0, list of acceptable values, etc.  Allow utility methods
    for accessing these annotations for other classes when trying to set
    properties.
  * Add XmlBeanFactory class with helpful utility methods for quickly creating
    instances of classes by reading xml files from the classpath, local disk,
    or even possibly more options.
  * Check that partial XML snippets actually work -- had issues using them while
    working on cortex project.

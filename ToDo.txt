* Assign a random name to the datasource if its set to null -- might allow for
  a more zero-configuration setup.

* Test cases for these scenarios:
  - basic configuration stuff?  values are setup correctly?
  - parsing of bad JDBC URLs?
  - are required properties validated?
  - waiting for a connection and timing out (if pool is exhausted, check that
    it times-out properly)  is this detectable in JMX?
  - what happens if the database connection pool fails -- does it eventually
    fix itself?  is that somehow detectable in JMX?

* Better aggregate JMX properties for determing if a pool is in "trouble" --
  maybe some sort of simple warning or severe state.

* Expose debugging properties

* Expose logging properties

* Some method of shutting down or destroying connection pools -- might need to
  implement some form of tracking

* Support for statement caching configuration (in c3p0)
